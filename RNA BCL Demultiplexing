### 1. Demultiplexing the Data ###

# Unlike the ATAC data which was single indexed, this data is double indexed, meaning that the sequences of both I7 and I5 barcodes were known:
# Index1 - I7 - TATCAGCCTA
# Index2 - I5 - AGGACGAAAC
# An inmportant note is that the installation of the BCL-convert software was not system-wide, therefore, it worked for a task as simple as single-indexed demux, but it did not work out for double-indexed demux.
# Therefore, I was forced to use the older pipeline called bcl2fastq, which however, works as well.
# Another difference between the ATAC and RNA demux processes, was that the ATAC was generated with 2 possible barcode bp mismatches, while the RNA was generated with one possible mismatch.

cd /scratch/mozturk/Pilot1

# 1) clean + recreate output folder
rm -rf scRNA_bcl2fastq_mm1
mkdir -p scRNA_bcl2fastq_mm1
cd scRNA_bcl2fastq_mm1

# 2) sample sheet (dual-index; this is the one from your sample sheet screenshot)
cat > SampleSheet_GEX_TT_C9.csv << 'EOF'

# 3) run bcl2fastq (creates I1 + I2 fastqs)

### 2. FastQC and MultiQC ###

cd /scratch/mozturk/Pilot1/scRNA_bcl2fastq_mm1/fastqs

# create QC directories
mkdir -p qc_fastqc qc_multiqc

# run FastQC on all FASTQs
nice -n 19 fastqc *.fastq.gz -o qc_fastqc -t 6

# run MultiQC
nice -n 19 multiqc qc_fastqc -o qc_multiqc


### 3. FastP QC ###

#Fastp is usually a tool used to process fastq files further, trim adapters, remove duplicates etc. However, since the cell ranger requires raw fastq files, fastp will be used to assess the total number of reads and percentage of duplicates, without filtering anything.
